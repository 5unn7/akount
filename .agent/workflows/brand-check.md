1. Identify user-facing content
Scan for changes in UI text, docs, or error messages.
2. Check brand tone
Verify the tone is helpful, professional, and aligns with Akount's brand voice.
3. Validate Canadian English
Check for Canadian spellings (e.g., "colour", "centre", "categorize" with -ize but Canadian context).
4. Provide recommendations
Suggest improvements for better brand alignment.
