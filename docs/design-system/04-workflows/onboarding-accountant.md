Founders onboarding is about *setup*.
Accountant onboarding is about *verification, boundaries, and confidence*.

If this is done right, accountants will **accept Akount as the system of record**, not ask for exports.

# 👥 ACCOUNTANT ONBOARDING FLOW — MASTER UX

## 🎯 Core Objective

Accountant onboarding must:

1. Establish **professional trust immediately**
2. Clarify **scope & responsibility**
3. Prevent **accidental overreach**
4. Surface **what needs attention**
5. Get the accountant productive in under **5 minutes**

No tutorials.
No marketing.
No fluff.

---

## 🧠 Mental Model

Accountant onboarding should feel like:

> “I’ve been invited into a controlled financial workspace with clear boundaries.”

Not:

> “I’m trying a new app.”

---

## 🧭 1. Entry Trigger

Accountants **never self-sign-up**.

They enter via:

* Email invite from founder
* Time-bound, entity-scoped link

This already signals seriousness.

---

## ✉️ 2. Invitation Email (Tone Matters)

Subject:

> **You’ve been invited to review financial records on Akount**

Body (key points only):

* Who invited them
* Which entities
* What level of access
* Why Akount is used (single source of truth)

CTA:
**Accept Invitation**

No hype language.

---

## 🔐 3. First Access Screen — Trust Primer

Before login details, show a **one-time primer**:

```
Welcome to Akount

You’ve been granted access to:
• 🇨🇦 Canadian Corp
• 🇺🇸 US LLC

Your role: Accountant
Your permissions:
✓ View transactions
✓ Post journal entries
✓ Review reconciliation
✗ Connect banks
✗ Delete data

Akount maintains immutable audit logs.
All actions are recorded.
```

This builds immediate confidence.

CTA:
**Continue to Workspace**

---

## 🔑 4. Authentication & Security Setup

Required (non-negotiable):

* Password or SSO
* 2FA setup

UX framing:

> “Required to protect financial records.”

Accountants expect this.

---

## 🌍 5. Context Confirmation (Critical Step)

Before showing data:

```
Confirm your working context

Default entities:
☑ 🇨🇦 Canadian Corp
☐ 🇺🇸 US LLC

Default period:
FY 2025

Accounting basis:
Accrual
```

Accountant explicitly confirms.

This avoids the #1 professional mistake: *working in the wrong scope*.

---

## 🧾 6. System Orientation (30-second Tour)

Not a product tour — a **professional orientation**.

3 cards only:

1. **Accountant Dashboard**

   > Review completeness & readiness

2. **Reconciliation Workspace**

   > Match bank to books

3. **Journal Entry Editor**

   > Post adjustments with audit trail

Each card links directly.

No walkthrough overlays.

---

## ✅ 7. Immediate Readiness Snapshot (First Real Screen)

The accountant lands on:

### **Accountant Dashboard v2** (already designed)

But with a **highlighted readiness banner**:

```
Financial Readiness Summary
──────────────────────────
⚠ 12 transactions uncategorized
✓ Jan 2025 reconciled
⚠ FX differences pending
```

This answers:

> “What do I need to do first?”

---

## 📌 8. Task Intake (Founder → Accountant)

If the founder requested help, show tasks immediately:

```
Requested Reviews
• Review Feb reconciliation (🇨🇦 Corp)
• Verify home office deduction
```

This removes email dependency from day one.

---

## 🧠 9. AI Transparency (Accountant-Specific)

Show a short notice:

> “AI suggestions are visible but never applied automatically.
> You remain the final authority.”

This is **huge** for professional acceptance.

---

## 🔍 10. Audit & Compliance Awareness

Before letting them work, surface:

* Audit logs location
* Period locking rules
* Reversal-only edits

This tells them:

> “This system respects accounting law.”

---

## 🔒 11. Permissions Reminder (Subtle, Persistent)

In header:
`Accountant View • Limited Permissions`

Hover tooltip:

> “Access limited to assigned entities and accounting actions.”

This prevents confusion later.

---

## 🔁 12. Ongoing Onboarding (Passive)

As they work, small passive nudges:

* “This period is ready to lock”
* “Unreconciled account detected”

Never tutorials.
Never modals.

---

## 🧠 Emotional Outcome

After onboarding, the accountant should feel:

> “This is a controlled, audit-safe system. I can work here.”

Not:

> “I need Excel as backup.”

That’s the difference between **tolerated software** and **adopted infrastructure**.

---

## 🧩 How This Fits the Akount System

| Role       | Onboarding Goal        |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| Founder    | Setup & clarity        |
| Accountant | Verification & control |
| AI         | Support, not authority |

Each role gets a **different truth surface**.
