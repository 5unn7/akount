This is the **trust bridge**.

If Akount is the *financial command center*,
**Accountant Collaboration & Permissions** is how professionals are invited inside **without giving away the keys**.

Done right, this turns Akount into:

> the shared system of record between founder and accountant

Done wrong, it becomes:

> “I’ll just export to Excel.”

# 👥 ACCOUNTANT COLLABORATION & PERMISSIONS — MASTER SYSTEM

## 🎯 Purpose

This system must:

1. Enable **safe professional collaboration**
2. Respect **legal & jurisdictional boundaries**
3. Maintain **audit-grade accountability**
4. Reduce back-and-forth and exports
5. Feel professional enough for CPAs

---

# 🧠 1. Mental Model

Think:

> Google Docs permissions + accounting controls

Not:

> Invite someone and hope for the best

Permissions in finance are **contracts**, not convenience.

---

# 🧭 2. Roles & Permission Philosophy

### Permission Layers

Permissions are controlled at **three levels**:

1. Workspace
2. Entity
3. Feature

No blanket access.

---

# 🧑‍💼 3. Built-in Roles (Opinionated Defaults)

| Role       | Intended User         |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| Owner      | Founder               |
| Admin      | Ops / finance lead    |
| Accountant | External professional |
| Bookkeeper | Data entry            |
| Viewer     | Advisor / investor    |

Roles are **starting points**, not cages.

---

# 🏢 4. Entity-Level Access (Critical)

Every collaborator must be assigned **explicit entities**.

Example:

> Accountant can access 🇨🇦 Corp and 🇺🇸 LLC
> No access to 👤 Personal

This prevents legal nightmares.

---

# 🧩 5. Feature-Level Permissions

Each role controls:

| Feature         | Example        |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| Transactions    | View / Edit    |
| Journal Entries | Create / Post  |
| Reconciliation  | Match / Review |
| Reports         | View / Export  |
| Rules           | View / Manage  |
| AI Insights     | View only      |

Default accountants:

* Can post journal entries
* Cannot delete transactions
* Cannot change bank connections

---

# 🧾 6. Invite Flow UX (Professional, Reassuring)

### Invite Screen

```
Invite Accountant
──────────────────
Email: jane@cpa.ca
Role: Accountant
Entities:
☑ 🇨🇦 Canadian Corp
☐ 🇺🇸 US LLC
☐ 👤 Personal

Permissions Preview
✓ View transactions
✓ Post adjustments
✗ Connect banks
✗ Delete data

[Send Invite]
```

Clarity prevents fear.

---

# 🔐 7. Accountant-Specific Workspace Mode

When an accountant logs in:

* Cleaner UI
* Reduced features
* Clear entity context
* “Accountant View” badge

Feels intentional, not restricted.

---

# 🧠 8. Collaboration Surfaces

### A. Comments & Mentions

* On transactions
* On journal entries
* On reports

Example:

> “@Sunny This expense needs clarification.”

This kills email threads.

---

### B. Review Requests

Founder can request:

* Reconciliation review
* Report sign-off
* Tax prep review

Accountant sees task list.

---

# 🧾 9. Approval & Locking Workflow

Optional but powerful.

Example:

* Bookkeeper enters data
* Accountant reviews
* Owner approves
* Period locks

This mirrors real accounting firms.

---

# 📜 10. Audit Log (Non-Negotiable)

Every action logs:

```
Jane CPA
Posted journal entry
Entity: 🇨🇦 Corp
Timestamp
Source: Manual
```

Logs are immutable.

This builds confidence.

---

# 🔁 11. Temporary & Time-Bound Access

Invite with:

* Expiration date
* Filing-season access only
* Emergency revoke

Finance requires **revocability**.

---

# 🧠 12. Human + AI Collaboration

AI knows when to escalate:

> “This issue may require a licensed accountant.”

Click → invite flow pre-filled.

AI supports professionals, doesn’t replace them.

---

# 🌍 13. Jurisdiction Awareness

Accountants see:

* Relevant tax rules
* Country-specific reports
* Local compliance indicators

No confusion across borders.

---

# 🎨 14. Tone & Visuals

| Element  | Rule         |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Language | Professional |
| Colors   | Neutral      |
| Icons    | Minimal      |
| UX       | Predictable  |

This is not a playful surface.

---

# 🧠 Emotional Outcome

Founder feels:

> “I’m in control, but not alone.”

Accountant feels:

> “This is a serious system.”

That’s the win.
