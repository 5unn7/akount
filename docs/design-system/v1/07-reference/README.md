# Reference

## Purpose

Reference documents contain technical debt, missing features, and other long-term considerations that don't fit neatly into active design system categories. These are tracked for future implementation.

## Files in This Category

- **`missing-features.md`** - Strategic roadmap of deferred features, prioritized by impact and complexity (consolidated from 2 files)

## When to Use

Reference these files when:
- Evaluating what features are planned but not yet implemented
- Planning future design system work
- Reviewing technical debt
- Understanding current limitations

## Related Categories

- All other categories - Features in this section may eventually be implemented across the design system
