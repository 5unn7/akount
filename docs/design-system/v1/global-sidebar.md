This is where the *personality* of Akount really shows. The sidebar is not just navigation, it’s the **mental model of global finance**.

It should feel like:

> 🧠 “Financial command center”
> not
> 📒 “Accounting menu”

# 🧭 GLOBAL SIDEBAR NAVIGATION SYSTEM

## 🎯 Purpose of the Sidebar

The sidebar must:

1. Orient users in a **complex financial world**
2. Reflect **entity + global structure**
3. Separate **operations** from **intelligence**
4. Scale as features grow

---

# 🧱 1. Sidebar Layout Structure

### Widths

| State     | Width |
| --------- | ----- |
| Collapsed | 80px  |
| Expanded  | 240px |

Sticky. Never scrolls away. This is the *anchor of control*.

---

## 🧭 2. Information Architecture

We organize by **how solopreneurs think**, not by accounting terms.

### 🔝 TOP: Workspace + Entity Context

```
[ Workspace Switcher ]
   Akount Workspace ▼

[ Active Entity Filter ]
🌍 All Entities   ▼
```

Entity filter affects the whole app.

# 🧠 5. Entity Awareness Everywhere

If user selects **🇨🇦 Canadian Corp**, show small badge near nav title:

`Transactions  🇨🇦`

Constant reinforcement = less cross-entity mistakes.

---

# 🌙 6. Dark Mode Strategy

Sidebar = slightly darker than content area
Creates a stable anchor feeling.

---

# ⚡ 7. Collapsed State Behavior

Only icons shown.

Hover = flyout tooltip with section grouping.

AI section icon has subtle violet glow.

---

# 🧩 8. AI Presence in Sidebar

If new AI insight exists:

• Small violet dot on “AI Advisor”
• Count badge (e.g., 3)

Feels like notifications from a *financial brain*.

---

# 🧭 9. Mental Model Summary

| Section        | User Brain Mode  |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| Overview       | Understanding    |

This is how global solopreneurs actually think.

# ✨ The Vibe

When someone opens Akount:

> “I am inside my financial control room.”

Not:

> “I’m inside bookkeeping software.”
