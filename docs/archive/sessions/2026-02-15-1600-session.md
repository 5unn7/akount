# Session Summary — 2026-02-15 16:00

## What Was Done
- Completed implementation of "Product Thinking, Session Lifecycle & Review-Aware Workflows" plan
- This session continued from a previous instance that ran out of context
- Finished work.md modifications: replaced 5-step per-task loop with 7-step version (investigate > review lens > implement > test > verify > learn > commit)
- Added "Capture Session Knowledge" section to work.md Phase 3 wrap-up
- Updated processes README.md to remove compound, add diagnose/end-session/audit
- Verified all 13 files and cross-references (product-thinking.md referenced correctly in 6 files, no stale compound references in active files)
- Committed all changes as e35c8ea

## Files Changed
- .claude/commands/processes/README.md
- .claude/commands/processes/audit.md

- .claude/rules/workflows.md
- CLAUDE.md

## Commits Made
- e35c8ea feat(rules): Add product-thinking, diagnose + end-session skills, review-aware workflows

## Patterns Discovered
- When continuing from a previous context-exhausted session, the plan file and todo list carry over correctly, making it straightforward to resume work
- Cross-reference verification (Grep for key terms across all files) is a reliable way to catch stale references after multi-file changes

## New Systems / Features Built
- `.claude/rules/product-thinking.md` — Globally-loaded cornerstone rule (investigation protocol, domain adjacency map, review lens, learning triggers)
- `/processes:diagnose` — 6-phase structured bug investigation skill
- `/processes:end-session` — Lightweight per-instance session capture (this file is first use!)
- Three-tier session lifecycle: end-session (per instance) > eod (daily aggregate) > audit (weekly promotion)
- Consolidated knowledge flow: end-session captures raw > EOD routes to artifacts/MEMORY > audit promotes to rules

## Unfinished Work
- None — all 12 planned file changes completed and committed

## Artifact Update Hints
- `CLAUDE.md` already updated (product-thinking in Layer 1, new skills in commands)
- `.claude/rules/workflows.md` already updated (new skills, compound removed)
- `MEMORY.md` needs update — Current State should note "Product Thinking + Session Lifecycle system implemented"
- `STATUS.md` / `TASKS.md` — if this work was tracked there, needs checkoff
