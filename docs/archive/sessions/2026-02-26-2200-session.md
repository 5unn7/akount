# Session Summary — 2026-02-26 22:00

## What Was Done

- **LLM Document Intelligence Platform brainstorm review & expansion** — Comprehensive multi-agent review of the existing brainstorm document with security-sentinel and compliance-researcher agents
- **Security gap analysis** — Identified 26 findings (7 critical, 9 high, 6 medium, 4 low) across PII handling, prompt injection, GDPR compliance, model security, audit trails, consent management, and cross-border data flows
- **Global compliance research** — Researched EU AI Act, GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, PIPEDA, SOC 2, copyright (Apache 2.0), and AML obligations for self-hosted Mistral LLM in financial services
- **Additional Mistral use cases identified** — 8 new capabilities beyond document scanning: NL bookkeeping, anomaly detection, smart search, report narration, client communication drafts, tax optimization suggestions, multi-language processing, agentic workflows
- **Brainstorm document restructured** — Rewrote from 4 horizontal phases into 6 vertical tracks (A-F) with 5 phased milestones, incorporating all security/compliance/expansion findings

## Files Changed

- `docs/brainstorms/2026-02-26-llm-document-intelligence-platform-brainstorm.md` — Major rewrite (~536 lines -> ~700+ lines, 4 phases -> 6 tracks + 5 phases)

## Commits Made

- None yet (brainstorm changes uncommitted)

## Patterns Discovered

- **EU AI Act: Akount likely NOT high-risk** — Automated bookkeeping/categorization doesn't evaluate creditworthiness, performs "narrow procedural tasks" (Article 6(3) exemption). Fraud detection AI explicitly exempt (Recital 58).
- **RAG over fine-tuning is the compliance-optimal architecture** — Makes GDPR right-to-erasure trivially simple (delete from retrieval store vs model retraining). Single most impactful architecture decision for compliance.
- **Self-hosted Mistral eliminates entire vendor risk category** — No third-party AI processor = no DPA with AI vendor, simpler SOC 2 scope, no cross-border AI data transfer.
- **Prompt injection = #1 financial integrity risk** — Crafted invoice with invisible text could manipulate extracted amounts. Defense: monetary threshold gate ($5K mandatory review) + Zod schema validation + structured output enforcement.
- **CCPA ADMT rules effective Jan 1, 2026** — Automated Decision-Making Technology pre-use notices required for California users.
- **Colorado AI Act effective June 2026** — First comprehensive US state AI law. Impact assessment may be required.
- **Canada AIDA is dead** — Bill C-27 died Jan 2025. PIPEDA remains. New privacy statute expected (fines up to C$25M / 5% revenue).
- **AML: Akount is NOT an MSB** — No AML obligations unless payment transmission features added.
- **Mistral OCR 3** — 2,000 pages/minute, thousands of languages, Apache 2.0. Upgrade from OCR 2503.

## New Systems / Features Designed (Not Built)

- **Track A: Core AI Infrastructure & Security** — PII redaction pipeline, prompt injection defense (5 layers), AIDecisionLog Prisma model, Mistral hardening
- **Track C: Smart Automation** — NL bookkeeping, anomaly detection, smart NL search, report narration, client comms, tax optimization
- **Track E: Compliance & Privacy** — Consent management, EU AI Act risk assessment, GDPR DPIA, CCPA ADMT notices, data retention, copyright/AML
- **Track F: Learning & Personalization** — RAG-over-fine-tuning architecture, per-tenant vector store, correction feedback loop
- **Compliance scorecard** — 15 regulatory provisions mapped to specific tracks

## Unfinished Work

None — brainstorm review and expansion complete. Document ready for `/processes:plan` per phase.

## Self-Reflection (AI Agent Quality Check)

### Did I Follow the Pre-Flight Checklist?
- [x] Read existing files before editing (read full brainstorm document)
- [x] Searched for patterns (agents searched codebase for existing compliance/security code)
- [x] Used agents for complex research (security-sentinel + compliance-researcher in parallel)
- [x] Agents checked existing code (audit-retention.ts, file-scanner.ts, compliance docs)

### Did I Violate Any Invariants?
- No code written — brainstorm/documentation session only

### Loops or Repeated Mistakes Detected?
- Agent output retrieval required 2 attempts (timeout on first) — expected for deep research

### What Would I Do Differently Next Time?
- Launch all web searches + agents in first parallel batch

### Context Efficiency Score (Self-Grade)
- **File reads:** Efficient — brainstorm read once, agents targeted specific files
- **Pattern verification:** Always verified — agents read actual code
- **Overall grade:** A (efficient parallel agent usage for research-heavy task)

## Artifact Update Hints
- `MEMORY.md` — Add: "RAG over fine-tuning for GDPR compliance", "EU AI Act: bookkeeping likely NOT high-risk", "Prompt injection = #1 financial integrity risk"
- `docs/brainstorms/` — Updated brainstorm uncommitted, needs commit
- No TASKS.md changes (ad-hoc brainstorm work, no tasks claimed)
