# Session Summary — 2026-02-22 22:30

## What Was Done
- Conducted comprehensive production readiness audit (scored 45/100 — strong app code, weak ops infra)
- Discussed deployment strategy: Vercel (web) + Railway (API) + Cloudflare (DNS/CDN)
- Confirmed domain: `akount.ai` (Namecheap)
- Recommended Cloudflare over Hostinger for DNS (free CDN, SSL, DDoS protection)
- Created full production launch plan covering 6 phases:
  - Phase 1: Sentry error tracking (web + API)
  - Phase 2: PostHog analytics (web only)
  - Phase 3: Deployment configuration (.env.example, Railway API, Vercel web)
  - Phase 4: Cloudflare DNS setup
  - Phase 5: CI/CD pipeline updates
  - Phase 6: Pre-launch checklist

## Files Changed
- None modified (planning session only)

## Commits Made
- None (no code changes)

## New Files Created
- `docs/plans/2026-02-22-production-launch.md` — Full 6-phase production launch plan (uncommitted)

## Patterns Discovered
- `apps/web/src/lib/error-tracking.ts` already has Sentry TODO at line 74 — all 50+ error.tsx files use `reportError()`, so wiring Sentry there gives instant coverage
- `apps/web/src/instrumentation.ts` doesn't exist yet — needed for Next.js 16 server-side Sentry
- `apps/web/src/app/global-error.tsx` doesn't exist — needed for root-level error boundary
- Graceful shutdown already implemented in API (`SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` handlers) — one less thing to build
- `railway.toml` currently only configures web app, needs rewrite for API deployment
- No `.env.example` exists — critical gap for onboarding and deployment

## Unfinished Work
- Production launch plan created but not yet executed
- Plan saved at `docs/plans/2026-02-22-production-launch.md` (uncommitted)
- Next step: begin Phase 1 (Sentry integration) when ready to execute
- Also uncommitted from prior sessions: 21 modified files (EmptyState consolidation, accounting pages, etc.)

## Self-Reflection (AI Agent Quality Check)

### Did I Follow the Pre-Flight Checklist?
- [x] Checked task availability — this was a planning/discussion session, no task needed
- [x] Read existing files before proposing changes (error-tracking.ts, layout.tsx, env.ts)
- [x] Searched for patterns via Grep (existing configs, deployment files)
- [x] Used offset/limit for large files — N/A (files read were small)
- [x] Verified patterns with Grep (confirmed no instrumentation.ts, no global-error.tsx)
- [x] Searched MEMORY topic files — reviewed current state from MEMORY.md

### Did I Violate Any Invariants?
- N/A — No code was written this session (planning only)

### Loops or Repeated Mistakes Detected?
- None

### What Would I Do Differently Next Time?
- Session went smoothly — focused discussion leading to concrete plan

### Context Efficiency Score (Self-Grade)
- **File reads:** Efficient — only read files needed for planning
- **Pattern verification:** Always verified — confirmed missing files via Glob
- **Memory usage:** Checked MEMORY.md at start
- **Overall grade:** A (efficient planning session)

## Artifact Update Hints
- `docs/plans/2026-02-22-production-launch.md` needs to be committed
- When execution starts: TASKS.md needs production launch tasks (INFRA prefix)
- After Sentry installed: `apps/web/CLAUDE.md` should document Sentry setup
- After deployment: `MEMORY.md` should note production URLs and deployment patterns
