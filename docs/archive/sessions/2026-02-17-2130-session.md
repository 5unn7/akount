# Session Summary — 2026-02-17 21:30

## What Was Done
- Extracted all actionable findings from `docs/reviews/smooth-floating-mountain.md` (architectural maturity audit) into TASKS.md
- Extracted all actionable findings from `docs/reviews/dashboard-overview/SUMMARY.md` (dashboard code review) into TASKS.md
- Cross-referenced both reviews against existing TASKS.md to avoid duplicates
- Added 32 new tasks total (24 from smooth-floating-mountain, 8 from dashboard-overview)
- Updated task counts and summary line in TASKS.md

## Files Changed
- `TASKS.md` — Added 32 new tasks from two review documents

## Commits Made
- None this session (TASKS.md changes are uncommitted, ready for user to commit)

## Patterns Discovered
- Section references (e.g., `§2.2.3`) in the Source column help trace tasks back to specific review sections for context when claiming

## Unfinished Work
- TASKS.md changes are uncommitted — user should review and commit

## Artifact Update Hints
- `TASKS.md` — 32 new tasks added, needs commit
- Task count went from 42 → 73
- Both reviews are now fully captured — no gaps remaining
