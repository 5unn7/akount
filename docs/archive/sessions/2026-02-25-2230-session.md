# Session Summary — 2026-02-25 22:30

## What Was Done
- Verified TEST-7 through TEST-13 (frontend test infrastructure + utility tests) — all 75 tests passing, already complete
- Verified TEST-6 (data-export + report-export service tests) — all 69 tests passing, already complete
- **UX-3:** Added WCAG accessibility attributes to 4 accounting report views:
  - Trial Balance table: `aria-label`, `<caption class="sr-only">`, `scope="col"` on all `<th>`
  - GL Ledger table: `aria-label`, `<caption class="sr-only">`, `scope="col"` on all `<th>`
  - Revenue report: `role="progressbar"` + `aria-valuenow/min/max` + `aria-label` on progress bars
  - Spending report: `role="progressbar"` + `aria-valuenow/min/max` + `aria-label` on progress bars
- **UX-18:** Investigated and confirmed already fully built (accounting landing page with stats, JEs, COA snapshot, income summary)
- Marked UX-3 and UX-18 as complete in TASKS.md

## Files Changed
- `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/accounting/reports/trial-balance/tb-report-view.tsx` — a11y attributes
- `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/accounting/reports/general-ledger/gl-report-view.tsx` — a11y attributes
- `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/accounting/reports/revenue/revenue-report-view.tsx` — progressbar role
- `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/accounting/reports/spending/spending-report-view.tsx` — progressbar role
- `TASKS.md` — marked UX-3, UX-18 complete

## Commits Made
- None yet (uncommitted changes from this session)

## Bugs Fixed / Issues Hit
None

## Patterns Discovered
None — straightforward a11y additions following WCAG table and progressbar patterns.

## Unfinished Work
- Uncommitted changes for UX-3 (4 report view files) + TASKS.md updates need committing

## Self-Reflection (AI Agent Quality Check)

### Did I Follow the Pre-Flight Checklist?
- [x] Checked task availability (Step 0) before implementation
- [x] Read existing files before editing (never edited blindly)
- [x] Searched for patterns via Grep before creating new code
- [x] Used offset/limit for large files (>300 lines)
- [x] Verified patterns with Grep (didn't claim patterns without proof)
- [x] Searched MEMORY topic files before implementing

### Did I Violate Any Invariants?
- [x] Used design tokens (no hardcoded colors) — no color changes made
- [x] No mixing server imports with 'use client' — only added HTML attributes

### Loops or Repeated Mistakes Detected?
None — session was clean and efficient.

### Context Efficiency Score (Self-Grade)
- **File reads:** Efficient — used offset/limit on all 7 report views
- **Pattern verification:** Always verified — read exact code before editing
- **Memory usage:** Checked at session start
- **Overall grade:** A (efficient)

## Artifact Update Hints
- UX-3 and UX-18 already marked in TASKS.md
- No new endpoints or utilities created — no CLAUDE.md updates needed
