# Session Summary — 2026-02-15 17:00

## What Was Done
- Completed Phase 3: Post Your Money — discovered it was ~95% built already (not "not started" as TASKS.md claimed)
- Deep codebase exploration revealed: backend PostingService (852 lines, 33 tests), COA/JE frontend pages, transaction posting UI all pre-existing
- Fixed 5 console.error calls across 2 files (COA client + TransactionsListClient) — replaced with user-facing error state
- Fixed React import ordering in journal-entries-client.tsx (moved from bottom to top)
- Fixed deactivate endpoint mismatch in accounting.ts API client (POST /deactivate → DELETE /:id)
- Added postingError state with dismissable error banners to posting Sheet UI
- Updated TASKS.md, STATUS.md, ROADMAP.md to reflect Phase 3 COMPLETE
- Created completion plan: docs/plans/2026-02-15-phase-3-completion.md
- Ran /insights — generated usage report (127 sessions, 841 messages, 124h, 75 commits)

## Files Changed

## Commits Made
- 68fd151 fix(web): Complete Phase 3 cleanup — console.error, imports, endpoint alignment

## Bugs Fixed / Issues Hit
- **Deactivate endpoint mismatch:** Frontend called `POST /api/accounting/chart-of-accounts/${id}/deactivate` but backend route is `DELETE /api/accounting/chart-of-accounts/${id}`. Root cause: frontend was written against planned API shape, not actual implementation. Fixed by aligning API client.
- **console.error in production code:** 5 instances across COA client (3) and TransactionsListClient (2). Replaced with `actionError`/`postingError` state + dismissable UI banners.
- **React import at bottom of file:** journal-entries-client.tsx had `import React from 'react'` at line 497. Merged with existing useState import at top.

## Patterns Discovered
- Phase tracking can drift dramatically from reality — TASKS.md showed Phase 3 as "Not started" when it was 95% built
- Deep codebase exploration before planning saves massive time — the revised plan was 7 small tasks instead of 40-50 hours of new work

## Unfinished Work
- None — all 7 planned tasks completed and committed

## Artifact Update Hints
- `MEMORY.md` needs "Current State" update: Phase 3 → COMPLETE, next is Phase 4
- `MEMORY.md` "Recent Work Summary" should add 2026-02-15 Phase 3 completion entry
