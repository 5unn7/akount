# Session Summary — 2026-02-23 15:30

## What Was Done
- **DEV-73 + DEV-74: Vendor & Client CRUD (Create/Edit)** — Full implementation
  - Created shared `VendorForm` Sheet component (create/edit dual mode)
  - Created shared `ClientForm` Sheet component (create/edit dual mode)
  - Added "New Vendor" / "New Client" buttons to list pages
  - Replaced inline `EditVendorDialog` (~140 lines) with shared `VendorForm` on vendor detail page
  - Replaced inline `EditClientDialog` (~140 lines) with shared `ClientForm` on client detail page
  - Net -239 lines by extracting duplicate form code into reusable components
  - TypeScript compilation: zero errors

## Files Changed
- **NEW:** `apps/web/src/components/business/VendorForm.tsx` — Sheet-based create/edit form
- **NEW:** `apps/web/src/components/business/ClientForm.tsx` — Sheet-based create/edit form

- **MODIFIED:** `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/business/clients/clients-list-client.tsx` — Added "New Client" button + ClientForm
- **MODIFIED:** `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/business/vendors/[id]/vendor-detail-client.tsx` — Replaced inline EditVendorDialog with VendorForm
- **MODIFIED:** `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/business/clients/[id]/client-detail-client.tsx` — Replaced inline EditClientDialog with ClientForm

## Commits Made
- `a862eaa` feat(business): add vendor/client create + edit forms (DEV-73, DEV-74)

## Bugs Fixed / Issues Hit
None — clean implementation session.

## Patterns Discovered
None — followed established InvoiceForm/BillForm Sheet pattern.

## Unfinished Work
None — DEV-73 + DEV-74 fully complete.

## Self-Reflection (AI Agent Quality Check)

### Did I Follow the Pre-Flight Checklist?
- [x] Checked task availability (Step 0) before implementation — plan existed from prior session
- [x] Read existing files before editing (never edited blindly)
- [x] Searched for patterns via Grep before creating new code
- [x] Used offset/limit for large files (>300 lines) — files were under 300 lines
- [x] Verified patterns with Grep (didn't claim patterns without proof)
- [x] Searched MEMORY topic files before implementing

### Did I Violate Any Invariants?
- [x] All queries included tenantId filter ✅ (no backend changes)
- [x] All money fields used integer cents (no floats) ✅ (no financial logic)
- [x] All financial records soft-deleted (no hard deletes) ✅ (no delete logic)
- [x] All page.tsx files have loading.tsx + error.tsx ✅ (no new pages)
- [x] No mixing server imports with 'use client' ✅
- [x] Used design tokens (no hardcoded colors) ✅
- [x] Used request.log/server.log (no console.log in production) ✅
- [x] No `: any` types (used specific types or unknown) ✅

### Loops or Repeated Mistakes Detected?
None — session was a continuation from a prior session with plan already approved. Implementation went smoothly.

### Context Efficiency Score (Self-Grade)
- **File reads:** Efficient — read files needed for verification before editing
- **Pattern verification:** Always verified — checked existing InvoiceForm/BillForm patterns
- **Memory usage:** Checked MEMORY.md at session start
- **Overall grade:** A (efficient) — continuation session with clear plan, minimal wasted context

## Artifact Update Hints
- TASKS.md: DEV-73 and DEV-74 should be marked complete with commit `a862eaa`
