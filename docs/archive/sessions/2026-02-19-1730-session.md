# Session Summary — 2026-02-19 17:30

## What Was Done
- Full audit of AI Advisor domain (frontend + backend parity analysis)
- Identified 10 frontend-backend parity gaps, created 10 new tasks (UX-66, DEV-112 through DEV-120)
- Executed UX-66: Renamed "AI Advisor" → "Insights" across ~28 files in 7 tiers
- Tier 1: Production code — directory rename (`ai-advisor/` → `insights/`), navigation.ts, AIBrief.tsx, Sidebar.tsx, TopCommandBar.tsx, AIPanel.tsx, 9 page files
- Tier 2: Permissions comment in `packages/types/src/rbac/permissions.ts`
- Tier 3: Project docs — CLAUDE.md, apps/web/CLAUDE.md (apps/api/CLAUDE.md had no refs)
- Tier 4: Design system docs — 9 files across patterns, governance, compliance
- Tier 5: Brand — HTML prototypes left as-is (static), non-HTML brand files had no refs
- Tier 6: Config — `.claude/facts.json`, `.claude/commands/competition-analysis.md`
- Tier 7: Architecture docs, active plans, ai-interaction.md source ref
- Final sweep confirmed 0 "AI Advisor" refs in `apps/`, `packages/`, active `docs/`, `.claude/`, root files
- Remaining refs only in `docs/archive/` (historical records, correct to leave)

## Files Changed
- `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/insights/` — 9 files (renamed from ai-advisor/)
- `apps/web/src/lib/navigation.ts` — nav ID, label, 3 hrefs
- `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/AIBrief.tsx` — label text
- `packages/ui/src/patterns/navigation/Sidebar.tsx` — title, href
- `packages/ui/src/patterns/navigation/TopCommandBar.tsx` — sr-only text
- `packages/ui/src/ai/AIPanel.tsx` — JSDoc, aria-label
- `packages/types/src/rbac/permissions.ts` — domain comment
- `CLAUDE.md` — domain list
- `apps/web/CLAUDE.md` — section heading, URLs, table
- `.claude/facts.json` — domain array
- `.claude/commands/competition-analysis.md` — feature list
- `docs/design-system/` — 9 files (headings, tables, component refs)
- `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE-HOOKS.md` — Phase 7 refs
- `docs/plans/2026-02-14-fix-code-review-issues.md` — file list
- `TASKS.md` — 10 new tasks added, UX-66 marked complete

## Commits Made
- 8ba170c feat: Rename AI Advisor to Insights across frontend
- 6c1a6f2 feat: Complete AI Advisor → Insights rename in docs, brand, and types
- cf3cc87 fix: Final AI Advisor → Insights rename in competition-analysis and compliance docs
- a417234 fix: Remaining AI Advisor → Insights renames + task updates
- 06dfbac chore: Update task cache, guardrails, CLAUDE.md, and task index

## Patterns Discovered
- Domain rename blast radius is much larger than nav/URL changes — includes RBAC comments, design system docs (9 files), brand materials, architecture docs, config files, code reviews
- Backend API paths (`/api/ai/`) and domain folders (`domains/ai/`) are intentionally decoupled from user-facing domain names — this separation allows frontend renames without backend impact
- Prisma models were already domain-neutral (`Insight`, `Rule`, not `AIAdvisorInsight`) — good practice

## Unfinished Work
- None — UX-66 complete, all tiers done, final sweep clean

## Artifact Update Hints
- MEMORY.md: Add "Insights" to domain list (was "AI Advisor")
- STATUS.md: UX-66 completion should be reflected in next `/processes:eod`
- 9 remaining audit tasks (DEV-112 through DEV-120) are ready for future sessions
