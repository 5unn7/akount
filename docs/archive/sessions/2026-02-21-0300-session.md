# Session Summary — 2026-02-21 03:00

## What Was Done
- Completed **Banking Command Center Sprint 3: Polish + Mobile** (5/5 tasks)
- Added mobile responsive breakpoints to balance hero components (28px mobile → 40px desktop)
- Made Account Detail balance+sparkline stack vertically on small screens
- Made Transactions page header stack title/actions on mobile
- Improved SpendingBreakdown category name truncation for mobile
- Deleted 8 deprecated account components (-726 lines of dead code)
- Verified all 1076 API tests pass with no regressions
- **Banking Command Center plan is now 100% COMPLETE** (28/28 tasks across 4 sprints)

## Files Changed
- `apps/web/src/components/banking/BankingBalanceHero.tsx` — responsive balance text
- `apps/web/src/components/banking/AccountDetailHero.tsx` — responsive balance + sparkline layout
- `apps/web/src/components/banking/SpendingBreakdown.tsx` — responsive category truncation
- `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/banking/transactions/page.tsx` — responsive header layout
- `docs/plans/banking-command-center_tasks.md` — Sprint 3 tasks marked complete
- **DELETED:** `AccountsList.tsx`, `AccountsListClient.tsx`, `AccountRow.tsx`, `AccountStatsPills.tsx`, `AccountsBalanceHero.tsx`, `AccountCard.tsx`, `AccountDetailHeader.tsx`, `AccountsPageHeader.tsx`

## Commits Made
- `aa45e6e` feat(UX): Sprint 3 — Mobile responsive polish + delete 8 deprecated components

## Patterns Discovered
- The old `components/accounts/` directory had 8 unused components from the pre-Command Center era. The entire `AccountsList → AccountsListClient → AccountRow` chain was dead — not imported from any page after the AccountCardGrid replacement.
- StatsGrid already has proper mobile breakpoints (`grid-cols-2` base → `md:grid-cols-3` → `lg:grid-cols-4/5`), so no changes were needed there.

## Unfinished Work
- None for Banking Command Center — plan is complete.

## Self-Reflection (AI Agent Quality Check)

### Did I Follow the Pre-Flight Checklist?
- [x] Checked task availability (Sprint 3 tasks in banking-command-center_tasks.md)
- [x] Read existing files before editing (read all hero, grid, stats, chart components)
- [x] Searched for patterns via Grep (verified component imports before deleting)
- [x] Used offset/limit for large files (account detail page read in sections)
- [x] Verified patterns with Grep (confirmed 0 imports for each deleted component)
- [x] Searched MEMORY topic files (checked MEMORY.md for current state)

### Did I Violate Any Invariants?
- All checks pass — this was purely frontend responsive + cleanup work, no financial/DB/auth changes.

### Loops or Repeated Mistakes Detected?
- First Read attempt failed with "File has not been read yet" error — needed to re-read files before editing. This is a tool state issue, not a logic error. Added fresh reads before edit batch.

### Context Efficiency Score (Self-Grade)
- **File reads:** Efficient — used offset/limit where appropriate, batched parallel reads
- **Pattern verification:** Always verified — Grep confirmed 0 imports before every deletion
- **Memory usage:** Checked MEMORY.md at session start
- **Overall grade:** A

## Artifact Update Hints
- `docs/plans/banking-command-center_tasks.md` — Already updated (all sprints ✅)
- Plan status should be marked COMPLETE in any tracking
- MEMORY.md could note Banking Command Center completion
